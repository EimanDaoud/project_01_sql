# Background
### The Questions i wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:
1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL**: The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL**: The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code**: My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub**: Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.
# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Here’s how I approached each question:

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM 
    job_postings_fact f
LEFT JOIN company_dim c ON f.company_id = c.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

Here's the breakdown of the top data analyst jobs in 2023:

- **Wide Salary Range:** Top 10 paying data analyst roles span from $184,000 to $650,000, indicating significant salary potential in the field.
- **Diverse Employers:** Companies like SmartAsset, Meta, and AT&T are among those offering high salaries, showing a broad interest across different industries.
- **Job Title Variety:** There's a high diversity in job titles, from Data Analyst to Director of Analytics, reflecting varied roles and specializations within data analytics.

### 2. Skills for Top Paying Jobs
To understand what skills are required for the top-paying jobs, I joined the job postings with the skills data, providing insights into what employers value for high-compensation roles.
```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (

SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM 
    job_postings_fact f
LEFT JOIN company_dim c ON f.company_id = c.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10
)
SELECT 
    t.*,
    skills
FROM top_paying_jobs t
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim s ON t.job_id = s.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim d ON s.skill_id = d.skill_id
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
```
Here's the breakdown of the most demanded skills for the top 10 highest paying data analyst jobs in 2023:

- **SQL** is leading with a bold count of 8.
- **Python** follows closely with a bold count of 7.
- **Tableau** is also highly sought after, with a bold count of 6. Other skills like R, Snowflake, Pandas, and Excel show varying degrees of demand.

### 3. In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts
This query helped identify the skills most frequently requested in job postings, directing focus to areas with high demand.

```sql
SELECT
    skills,
    COUNT(s.job_id) AS demand_count
FROM job_postings_fact jpf
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim s ON jpf.job_id = s.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim d ON s.skill_id = d.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_work_from_home = TRUE
GROUP BY
    skills
ORDER BY
    demand_count DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
Here's the breakdown of the most demanded skills for data analysts in 2023

- **SQL** and **Excel** remain fundamental, emphasizing the need for strong foundational skills in data processing and spreadsheet manipulation.
- **Programming** and **Visualization Tools** like **Python**, **Tableau**, and **Power BI** are essential, pointing towards the increasing importance of technical skills in data storytelling and decision support.

| Skills |  Demand Count |
|--------|---------------|
|SQL     |7291           |
|Excel   |4611           |
|Python  |4330           |
|Tableau |3745           |

### 4. Skills Based on Salary
Exploring the average salaries associated with different skills revealed which skills are the highest paying.
```sql
SELECT
    skills,
    ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 0) AS avg_salary
FROM job_postings_fact jpf
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim s ON jpf.job_id = s.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim d ON s.skill_id = d.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    AND job_work_from_home = TRUE
GROUP BY
    skills
ORDER BY
    avg_salary DESC
LIMIT 25;
```
